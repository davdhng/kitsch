# What the heck is a Kitsch?

Kitsch is the ultimate "minimalist" CSS framework. It includes most of what you need to style a basic project.
The only difference between Kitsch and the thousands of other CSS frameworks is its ~~flashiness~~ beauty.
If you want your boilerplate to include a lot of exaggerated and excessive styling, you should use Kitsch.

## How to Install
__Install with NPM__

`$ npm install kitsch-css`

__Use the CDN__

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/kitsch-css" />
```
